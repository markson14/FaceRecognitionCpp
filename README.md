# Face-Recognition-Cpp

### :fire: Updates:

#### 2020.03.10

- Make Face Detection(MTCNN & RetinaFace) as an individual function to call.

#### 2020.01.09

- Add Edge-distance detection && face angle for extensional usage

#### 2019.10.31

- Add RetinaFace TVM module as face detector, the bboxes and pts are much stabler than MTCNNs'
- Ablation Experiment

### Introduction

- Detect:
  - [Optional] [Fast-MTCNN](https://github.com/imistyrain/MTCNN/tree/master/Fast-MTCNN)
  - [Default] [RetinaFace-TVM](https://github.com/Howave/RetinaFace-TVM)
- Verification: MobileFaceNet + Arcface

This project is using **Fast-MTCNN** for face detection and **TVM inference model** for face recognition. At the face detection stage, the the module will output the `x,y,w,h` coordinations as well as `5` facial landmarks for further alignment. At the face recognition stage, the `112x112` image crop by the first stage output will be the second stage input. The output will be an `1x128` feature vector for cosine similarity measuring. The recognition pipeline can run 50FPS on CPU **(2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7)**.

### Dependency:

- OpenCV >= 3.4.1
- TVM

### Set up:

- **OpenCV**

```shell
brew install opencv
brew link opencv
brew install pkg-config
pkg-config --cflags --libs /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/<version_number>/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc
```

- **[TVM](https://docs.tvm.ai/install/from_source.html#python-package-installation)**

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/tvm

mkdir build
cp cmake/config.cmake build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

- **tvm_complier**

  Now you are able create your own .so file by using pretrained MXNet models on your own environment. Here I am using mobilefacenet-arcface model as face recognition backbone.

- **CMakeList.txt**

  `modify the TVM path into your own `

- **Prefix:** set the prefix model path to your own.

- **Recording ground truth:**`mkdir img` and set record to `1` to record ground truth image for face recognition.

---

### Run:

Run the project may activate your camera to capture images.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
./FaceRecognitionCpp
```

---

### **Tun-able Parameters：**

1. **minSize:** set the minimum size of faces for MTCNN detector. Larger size can ensure quick inference time.
2. **factor:** set the step factor for pyramid of image.  Larger factor will get fewer images after doing pyramid.
3. **Frame size:** set the camera or streaming capturing frame size.
4. **Stage:** set how many stage for MTCNN to implement.
5. **Average Faces:** default 1 

### #TODO

- [ ] Quantize ArcFace
- [ ] Quantize RetinaFace
